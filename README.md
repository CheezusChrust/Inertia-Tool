# Inertia Tool
A tool that lets you set the rotational inertia of entities independent of their mass. You can set inertia directly, or you can set inertia as a multiple of the entity's default.

# Q&A:

### Isn't this the same as E:propInertia(V) in E2/Starfall?
Yes, this is just the tool version of that. The main difference is that, if this tool is installed, props duped with modified inertia will retain it after being respawned.

### Will this work on servers without the tool?
No. As far as I know, that isn't possible. Use E2 or Starfall to set inertia on servers without this tool if you need to.
